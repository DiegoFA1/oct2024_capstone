# Diego's Capstone Project

### Project
A key challenge in book recommendation systems is delivering personalized suggestions that resonate with readers' preferences.With countless books available, finding one that matches individual tastes can be tedious.Existing systems may not fully capture a reader's interests based on factors like author, publication year, or user ratings.

### Goal
Develop a recommendation system using nearest neighbor and collaborative filtering models. These models will analyze user preferences and book attributes, such as titles, authors, publication years, and ratings. The nearest neighbor approach will identify similar users or books, while collaborative filtering will suggest books based on users with similar reading patterns.

### Data
The Book-Crossing dataset comprises three key files:

    Users: Contains anonymized user information, including demographics like location and age (if available).
    
    Books: Identified by ISBN, this file includes book titles, authors, publication years, publishers, and cover image URLs from Amazon.
    
    Ratings: Includes user ratings for books, both explicit (on a scale of 1-10) and implicit (indicated by a rating of 0).
    This data is essential for analyzing user preferences and behavior, which is critical for developing an effective recommendation model
    using nearest neighbor and collaborative filtering techniques.
